Note regarding Custom selection:
Type the coordinates where you want to spawn on the second line of this file in the format x,y,z.
Take care that you have an idea where you're going ahead of time. Spawning far off the map or inside other objects can 
have unintended and at times gamebreaking consequences.  If you're not using the Custom selection then this line can be safely ignored.
